# Concept
* Given I am user who wants to find a recipe
* When I enter the category of food and click the search button
* Then I am presented with a list of recipes
* Given  I am a user who views a list of recipes
* When I click on one recipe
* Then I am presented with the selected recipe
* Given I am a user who wants to create a recipe
* When I view a recipe
* Then I also view ingredients for that recipe
* Given I am a user who wants information about nutrition
* When I view ingredients for a recipe
* Then I am presented with nutrition facts for these ingredients
